                                          Greetings to all!
                                                  
This is a repo dedicated to help those who are taking MIT's edX course : 6.00.2x-Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science! It is created to help people new or experienced to python programming by providing the solutions of the problem sets in a easy to understand manner. I encourage you to read the code many times till you fully understand it and not blindly copy and paste it! For any comments, suggestions or questions you are welcome to contact me in my email!


P.S. Some parts of the problem set 5 code which refers to graphs are not entirely correct so don't just copy and paste them. I will upload them in case you need some help getting started with this problem set.  If you have corrected/improved this part of my code please be kind to share it here and i will share it here with all of you!


Happy Coding!
